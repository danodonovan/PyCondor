PyCondor
========

This is (currently) and short and sweet effort to access condor and DAGMan job
managament from within python. Current plan: to use subprocess execution to 
platform condor.

Plan
----
condor_class: # should be renamed

	init with keyword args (covering args in submit file)

		required kwargs are set into self.args

		if required kwarg is missing sensible default set
		else raise error

		non-required kwargs also set
			- is this daft? Maybe have set of possibles and if non-required and 
			possible then set?

		non-condor args set

	_call_condor args

		internal function which calls system condor
			- possibly use condor_settings file to initiate paths etc.

	submit

	status

	kill

To Be Considered
----------------
	How do we handle multiple jobs

	How do we handle DAGs

	What other classes are needed, and where is the inheritance
